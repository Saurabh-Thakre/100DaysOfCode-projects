# 100DaysOfCode-projects
In this repository, I will be storing all my projects which I'd be doing under 100daysofcode challenge. I'd appreciate if you look around a little here !

#### My second Project was Creating my own personal AI using Python. I've created Jarvis using python, I've not used Machine learning yet. I wanted to keep it simple at first.

#### To install it, you might have to install the couple libraries using pip. I've tried to mention those libraries in the code with comments. And then just run main.py file like following 

`git clone https://github.com/Saurabh-Thakre/100DaysOfCode-projects.git`

`python main.py`

You guys can fork this repo, and if you see any modifications needed or you see new feature could be added. Just do a Pull request :)

Thanks,
