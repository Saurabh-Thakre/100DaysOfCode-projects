# 100DaysOfCode-projects
In this repository, I will be storing all my projects which I'd be doing under 100daysofcode challenge. I'd appreciate if you look around a little here

## My second Project was Creating my own personal AI using Python. I've created Jarvis using basic python, I've not used Machine learning yet. I wanted to keep it simple at first.

### To install it, you miught have to install the couple libraries using pip. I've tried to mention those libraries in the code with comments. And then just run main.py file like `python main.py`

You guys can fork this repo, and if you see any modifications needed or you see new feature could be added. Just do a Pull request :)

THanks,
